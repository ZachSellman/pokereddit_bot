This is the pokereddit bot. It is meant to pull data from the Reddit API via PRAW and analyze the results.

Currently it is designed to iterate through all comments and posts on r/pokemon from the previous day looking for mentions of the original 151 pokemon. It tallies these mentions, and outputs a dictionary with the resulting Top Five mentions.

In the future I plan to add more features such as spacy sentiment-analysis, and results storage.
